# Personal notes about engineering

## Objective
* Find quickly often-used concepts/formulas/algorithms/code
* Explain these concepts in my own words
* Help me remember these concepts when I build these notes

## Guidelines
* Be efficient
    - Only pursue what is approachable and interesting.
    - Do it as you can, no perfection.
* Store knowledge, not information
    - Do not be thorough but concise, only what matters along with the though path I need to understand it
* Write in my own words to myself

| ROS2               | For Kalman demo              |  Stand-by   |
| Python             | basics, numPy, SciPy, OpenCV | In Progress |
| C++                | basics, Eigen, OpenCV        |  Stand-by   |

## In Progess
- Camera calibration
- Knowing distance between red and yellow dot, compute distance, with a few assumptions (in vertical plane no z-rotation w.r.t. camera)
- Compute measurement angle
- Implement Kalman filter
- Improve rviz for real-time demo
- Check and tune rates
