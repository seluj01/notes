# Personal notes about engineering

## Objective
* Find quickly often-used concepts/formulas/algorithms/code
* Explain these concepts in my own words
* Help me remember these concepts when I build these notes

## Guidelines
* Be efficient
    - Only pursue what is approachable and interesting.
    - Do it as you can, no perfection.
* Store knowledge, not information
    - Do not be thorough but concise, only what matters along with the though path I need to understand it
* Write in my own words to myself
